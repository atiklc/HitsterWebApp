This is an app for Hitster, a song guessing game.

The aim of this app is to simplify player and host interaction during Hitster.
The host can start up a game, choose one of three levels of difficulty, create and end rounds and game.
The players can join game, submit their guesses via their devices and check the results and standings on a single screen.
The app calculates points for every round ends and creates a Standings table.

There's no limit of rounds.

Enjoy :)
