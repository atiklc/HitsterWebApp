This is an app for Hitster, a song guessing game.

The aim of this app is to simplify player and host interaction during Hitster.
The host can start up a game, choose one of three point levels, create and end rounds.
The players can join game, submit their guesses via their devices and check the results and standings.
The app calculates points for every round ends, with different point levels.

There's no limit of rounds.

Enjoy :)
